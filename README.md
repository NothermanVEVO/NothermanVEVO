### 🌟 About me
Studying a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I love programming, drawing, reading (both books and manga), watching movies and anime. Most of my free time I spend programming, whether during a class break or while I'm on the bus, when I get tired I do these other things that I mentioned that I also like to do.
